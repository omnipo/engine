// not contain any non-bit-copyable member variables!

// Furthermore, the class members need to be packed so they are aligned

// WebInputEvent --------------------------------------------------------------

class WebInputEvent {
public:
    // When we use an input method (or an input method editor), we receive
    // two events for a keypress. The former event is a keydown, which
    // provides a keycode, and the latter is a textinput, which provides
    // a character processed by an input method. (The mapping from a
    // keycode to a character code is not trivial for non-English
    // keyboards.)
    // To support input methods, Safari sends keydown events to WebKit for
    // filtering. WebKit sends filtered keydown events back to Safari,
    // which sends them to input methods.
    // Unfortunately, it is hard to apply this design to Chrome because of
    // our multiprocess architecture. An input method is running in a
    // browser process. On the other hand, WebKit is running in a renderer
    // process. So, this design results in increasing IPC messages.
    // To support input methods without increasing IPC messages, Chrome
    // handles keyboard events in a browser process and send asynchronous
    // input events (to be translated to DOM events) to a renderer
    // process.
    // This design is mostly the same as the one of Windows and Mac Carbon.
    // So, for what it's worth, our Linux and Mac front-ends emulate our
    // Windows front-end. To emulate our Windows front-end, we can share
    // our back-end code among Windows, Linux, and Mac.

    // used in Chrome any longer.
