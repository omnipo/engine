Debug Mode
==========

Sky can be switched into debug mode, in which:

 - documented asserts are checked and logged to the console
 - if you miss frame deadlines, your screen flashes (in addition to
   the exceptions throwing)
 - the dartanalyzer is run on all files and output logged to the
   console
 - code is run in checked mode
